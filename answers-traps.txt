1.  Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to `printf`?

    a registers contain arguments to functions. a2 holds 13.

2.  Where is the call to function `f` in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to `g`? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)

    26:	45b1                	li	a1,12

    14:	250d                	addiw	a0,a0,3

3.  At what address is the function `printf` located?

    0x630

4.  What value is in the register `ra` just after the `jalr` to `printf` in `main`?

    0x38

5.  Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);

    5.1 What is the output?

        HE110 World

    5.2 If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output?

        i = 0x726c6400

    5.3 Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

        No.

6.  In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);

    The value in a2. This happens because printf is expecting the third argument in a2 register.
